Project Status
==============

The latest version is **1.0.1** which was released on 2013-09-17, and is a backwards incompatible from the previous release.

The `project lives on GitHub <https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph/#python-call-graph>`_, where you can `report issues <https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph/issues>`_, contribute to the project by `forking the project <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ then creating a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_, or just `browse the source code <https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph/>`_.

The documentation needs some work stiil. Feel free to contribute :)

Features
========

* Support for Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+.
* Static visualizations of the call graph using various tools such as Graphviz and Gephi.
* Execute pycallgraph from the command line or import it in your code.
* Customisable colors. You can programatically set the colors based on number of calls, time taken, memory usage, etc.
* Modules can be visually grouped together.
* Easily extendable to create your own output formats.

Quick Start
===========

Installation is easy as::

    pip install pycallgraph

You can either use the `command-line interface <http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/develop/guide/command_line_usage.html>`_ for a quick visualization of your Python script, or the `pycallgraph module <http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/develop/api/pycallgraph.html>`_ for more fine-grained settings.

The following examples specify graphviz as the outputter, so it's required to be installed. They will generate a file called **pycallgraph.png**.

The command-line method of running pycallgraph is::

    $ pycallgraph graphviz -- ./mypythonscript.py

A simple use of the API is::

    from pycallgraph import PyCallGraph
    from pycallgraph.output import GraphvizOutput

    with PyCallGraph(output=GraphvizOutput()):
        code_to_profile()
