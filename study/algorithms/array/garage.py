# There is a parking lot with only one empty spot. Given the initial state
# of the parking lot and the final state. Each step we are only allowed to
# move a car
# out of its place and move it into the empty spot.
# The goal is to find out the least movement needed to rearrange
# the parking lot from the initial state to the final state.

# Say the initial state is an array:

# [1,2,3,0,4],
# where 1,2,3,4 are different cars, and 0 is the empty spot.

# And the final state is

# [0,3,2,1,4].
# We can swap 1 with 0 in the initial array to get [0,2,3,1,4] and so on.
# Each step swap with 0 only.
